<p>For hikers, there are literally hundreds of miles of trails to choose
from in the White Mountains, Acadia National Park, and Baxter State
Park. The scenery is so breathtaking in the White Mountains that circus
founder P.T. Barnum, upon reaching the top of mile-high Mt. Washington,
observed, "This is the second greatest show on earth." Trips vary
between overnight backpacking and day hikes out of a base camp.</p>
